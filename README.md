Open Poker HUD (Concept)
A proposed free, open-source poker heads-up display (HUD) to provide a comprehensive alternative to paid poker analysis software.
Vision
This project aims to develop a poker HUD that will help players analyze their games in real-time by displaying opponent statistics, tracking gameplay patterns, and providing actionable insights - all without subscription fees or paywalls.
Planned Features

Real-time Statistics: Track VPIP, PFR, AF and other crucial poker metrics during gameplay
Hand History Analysis: Import and analyze hand histories from major poker sites
Custom Filters: Create personalized filters to focus on specific game scenarios
Game Review Tools: Replay and analyze past hands with detailed breakdowns
Multi-Table Support: Track statistics across multiple tables simultaneously
Export Options: Save your data in various formats for external analysis

The Problem
The poker analysis software market is dominated by paid solutions that lock essential features behind subscriptions. This project aims to democratize poker analytics by providing high-quality tools accessible to players at all levels.
Roadmap

Phase 1: Hand history parser development
Phase 2: Core statistics engine implementation
Phase 3: Basic HUD overlay functionality
Phase 4: Database implementation for storing player data
Phase 5: Advanced features and UI refinement
